                    </h1>
                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        KernelTextRegion read-only is a security mitigation done by Apple to prevent patches to the kernel's critical parts.<br/>
                        It protects the kernel's __TEXT segment where crucial parts, such as pagetables are located and also prevents system register access to fake pages.<br/>
                        Well-known iOS hacker S1guza analyzed this mitigation a while ago and sadly I had to conclude that Apple did a great job with this mitigation to make it harder for people to bootstrap a secondary bootchain (kloader64) or create an extensive kernel debugger.<br/>
                        However, as s1guza described in his write-up initialization flaws may lead to compromising the kernel text region before it is locked as read-only.<br/>
                        In short, the kernel firstly starts building pagetables and then gives the entries segmentation with access rights.<br/>
                        These access rights define whether the segment is readable, writeable, executable a combination of these rights or completely inaccessible.<br/>
                        We know that accessing invalid memory or with improper access rights will result in a pagefault which the kernel will solve with a panic.<br/>
                        We thus have two ways to attack the kernel's initialization:<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>By exploiting it to such an extend that we can modify the segmentation rights</li>
                            <li>By exploiting it to such an extend that we can craft fake pages.</li>
                            <li>By exploiting it to such an extend that the MMU is turned off, but thats going to be hard and unlikely.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        We also know that XNU source code is publicly available and therefore we can pursuit two strategies to find a flaw suitable for one of the conditions above.<br/>
                        We can either use American Fuzzy Lop or another fuzzer to fuzz the initialization or manually do static analysis on the kernel.<br/>
                        Compiling XNU with AFL and then fuzzing it is going to be a massive time-loss.<br/>
                        The question is if fuzzing will be a good idea at initialization stage because it is really a low-level close to hardware.<br/>
                        Therefore I decided to go for static analysis.<br/>
                        We know that the kernel holds one segment that is widely controllable to a certain extend: The stack.<br/>
                        We also know that the stack must be initialized at some point during initialization.<br/>
                        Therefore I decided to look at options to interact with stack initialization.<br/>
                        Surprisingly I found an amazing flaw in the initialization that is easier to trigger than I could ever think.<br/>
                        
                    </p>
                    <h4>Hypothese</h4>
                    <p>
                        ...<br/>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Results</h4>
                    <p>
                       A segment overflow exists in XNU early boot initialization as one can pass a boot-argument later used to calculate the kernel stack size.  
                       However, this boot-argument is only treated by the bootloader on environments that have a less restrictive boot process.  
                        <br/>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
