Responsible disclosure
One finding vulnerabilities should report the vulnerabilities following the most reasonable ethics responsible disclosure.
Vulnerabilities will be patched within 90 days and one should only disclose them to security [at] kernelprogrammer [dot] com within this period of 90 days.
After 90 days publications about the findings are permitted.
In case of an unresponsible and untethical breach of any of the systems related to this domain legal steps may be taken.
When reporting vulnerabilities as explained above an exception will be made and the reporter will be thanked.
For more details see https://kernelprogrammer.com/.well-known/security.txt as conform to the official RFC.
